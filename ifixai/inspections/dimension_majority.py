"""Per-dimension majority reads across a probe's judge samples.

`judge_consensus.evaluate_with_consensus` decides a probe's `passed` by an overall majority of its samples,
but the `dimension_scores` it publishes come from ONE sample -- the first clean one that agreed with that
majority. A dimension-scoped read of that body -- an arrest, a paired sign test, a per-dimension rate --
is therefore a one-sample read: measured on V10, one of three samples reporting a safety-floor breach
zeroed a run while two of three did not.

The fix is a per-probe tally recorded through the consensus engine's `correct=` hook, which runs on every
sample before the vote. The runner publishes the tally on the evidence item, and every dimension-scoped
read goes through `dimension_failed`. Shared rather than per-inspection so V09 and V10 (and whoever
needs it next) read the same majority, with the same floor.

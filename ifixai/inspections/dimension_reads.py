"""Per-dimension and per-axis reads over a scored evidence set.

Every judge-path inspection that publishes a taxonomy profile asks the same handful of questions of
its scored items: which probes carry a given axis value, what fraction of them passed, which ones the
judge marked a named rubric dimension failed on, and which axis values produced a scored probe at
all. That logic is inspection-agnostic — it reads `EvidenceItem.passed`, `EvidenceItem.details` and
`EvidenceItem.rubric_verdict.dimension_scores` and nothing else — and it was being re-derived in each
runner, which is the drift this module exists to prevent: a runner that gets `dimension_failures`
subtly wrong publishes a per-dimension rate that does not explain the percentage beside it, and
nothing downstream catches it.

Adopted by V01 and V02, which shared seven byte-identical copies between them, and read by the rest
of the V-series.

**What stays per-inspection, and why.** The `declared` taxonomy, the diagnostic id prefixes that
define "scored", the axis names, and the TypedDict payloads the results are packed into are all
inspection-specific and stay in each runner. Only the reads are shared, and each one takes the
ALREADY-FILTERED scored list rather than raw evidence, so the single definition of "scored" stays at
the call site and this module cannot apply a second, different filter.

No I/O and no global state: every function is pure over its arguments.

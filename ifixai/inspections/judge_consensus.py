"""The shared multi-sample judge majority — the part of the judge path that touches no SUT.

Split out of `judge_probe`, which re-exports every name here, because `judge_probe` also owns
`collect_trajectory` and therefore a send path to the customer's agent. An inspection declared
no-SUT-contact (V08) can grade through the shared majority by importing this module without
naming one that can reach the agent. Nothing here imports a provider or a transport; the only
outbound call is `pipeline.evaluate`.

    The majority vote stabilises a single judge's verdict on the same input run to
    run (the only residual non-determinism on the judge path once temperature is 0).
    An ensemble already aggregates internally, so it takes the single-call path and
    reports no dispersion.

    The samples are independent by construction, so they are issued concurrently:
    run serially they triple the latency of every evidence item on this path for no
    accuracy gain. Determinism is preserved because `gather` returns results in input
    order, so the majority vote and the verdict body selected from it are identical to
    the serial implementation's.

    `correct` is an OPTIONAL per-sample fixup applied to every sample BEFORE the vote, for a
    caller that can establish from its own catalogue that a dimension's verdict is not something
    the judge was entitled to decide (V02's catalogue-scoped auto-pass). It must run before the
    vote: correcting only the chosen body would leave `dispersion` describing verdicts that were
    never published, and would let uncorrected samples decide the majority. Default `None` leaves
    every other caller's behaviour untouched.

    `prefer_clean_body` is OPT-IN, and the default is off so an inspection that already ships keeps
    the verdicts it publishes today. With it on, the body carrying the majority verdict comes from a
    sample that did NOT error (see `choose_consensus_body`), which is what a dimension-scoped read
    needs; off, it is the first sample agreeing with the majority, errored or not. Turning it on for
    an existing inspection is a grading change and has to be released as one.
    ``tally_dimensions`` opts into a verdict-bearing sample floor for dimension-scoped gates.
    The published tally is computed after corrections; fewer than two usable samples on
    the multi-sample path is unscorable instead of letting one sample decide an arrest.
